# Getting Started

To get started with JetBot follow these steps

## Step 1 - Setup your JetBot

To get started with the original JetBot kit, follow the instructions detailed [here](platforms/nvidia_jetbot).  We include the bill of materials, hardware setup and software setup needed to get started. 

You can also look into purchasing one of the [third party kits](third_party_kits).  The third party kits may have  alternate software or hardware setup steps.  We recommend referring to their documentation for instructions.

## Step 2 - Follow the Examples

After your JetBot is set up properly, it will display it's IP address on the small display screen.  Open up a web browser on your laptop, navigate to ``<jetbot_ip>:8888``, and type in the password ``jetbot`` to connect to your robot.  Then follow the example [notebooks](notebooks) to learn how to program JetBot.


## Step 3 - Create Something New

JetBot doesn't stop with the examples.  Once you've learned the basics, and are more comfortable with applying AI to new problems, 
that's when the real fun begins.  If you've made something after
using JetBot, we want to hear!  The

a great place to meet other develops, find help for anything Jetson related, and share your projects.  

The [JetBot GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot) is another great place to meet developers.  Just [open an issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/issues) if you've found a bug, or have something JetBot related you'd like to share.
