# Getting Started

To get started with JetBot follow these steps

## Step 1 - Setup a JetBot

Since we released the original JetBot,
many [third party kits](platforms/third_party_kits.md) have emerged, many of which are largely compatible with the JetBot software and examples.  To get started, you'll need to pick a [platform](platforms) of your choice, and
following it's vendor's instructions.  To get started with the original original JetBot, follow the
[instructions](platforms/nvidia_jetbot/README.md).

## Step 2 - Follow the Examples

Once you've got your JetBot all set up, you'll want to
learn how to use it!  The best way to do this is by following the
set of interactive [notebooks](notebooks) that we provide.

## Step 3 - Create Something New

JetBot doesn't stop with the examples.  Once you've learned the basics, and are more comfortable with applying AI to new problems, 
that's when the real fun begins.  If you've made something after
using JetBot, we want to hear!  The
[NVIDIA Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/agx-autonomous-machines/jetson-embedded-systems/jetson-projects/78) are
a great place to meet other develops, find help for anything Jetson related, and share your projects.  

The [JetBot GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot) is another great place to meet developers.  Just [open an issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/issues) if you've found a bug, or have something JetBot related you'd like to share.
