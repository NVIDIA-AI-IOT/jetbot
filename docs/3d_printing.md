# 3D Printing
This page has useful information related to printing the JetBot chassis using a 3D printer.  There are two methods for printing JetBot

* [Method 1 - Print by yourself](#method-1-print-by-yourself)
* [Method 2 - Use a printing service](#method-2-use-a-printing-service)

## Method 1 - Print by yourself

If you have a 3D printer, we recommend printing the JetBot components yourself!

### Print facts:

Below are some facts related to printing a single JetBot.

* Print time:  12-15 hours
* Material used:  ~ 100 grams
* Material cost:  ~ $2

### Tested Printers:

We've tested that the following printers are able to print JetBot successfully. If youâ€™re just beginning to enter the 3D printing space a [Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-kit-2) is highly recommended for its reliability. Where a [Creality Ender 3](https://amzn.to/3P78lP5) is less reliable but very affordable.

| Model | Cost | URL |
|------------|------|---|
| Creality Ender 3 | $189 | [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3P78lP5) |
| Prusa Mini | $429 | [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-kit-2/) |
| Prusa Mk3 | $799 | [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit-3/) |

### Tested Filaments:

Based on our experience, we recommend using PLA filament when printing JetBot.  Below is a collection
of filaments that we have tested with the [Ender 3](https://amzn.to/3P78lP5) and [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-kit-2/) 3D printers.

## Method 2 - Use a printing service

If you don't have a 3D printer on hand, and are not interested in purchasing one, there are external services
that can print the chassis for you.  Below are some quotes from popular 3D printing services

> Please note, we have not tested these services yet ourselves, so please proceed with caution.  If you
> find a print service that worked well for you, we'd love to hear!  Please let us know by creating
> an issue on GitHub or mentioning it in the chat channel
