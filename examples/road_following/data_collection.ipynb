    "2.  Training\n",
    "3.  Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll do the same exact thing!  Except, instead of classification, you'll learn a different fundamental technique, **regression**, that we'll use to\n",
    "enable JetBot to follow a road (or really, any path or target point).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Place the JetBot in different positions on a path (offset from center, different angles, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Remember from collision avoidance, data variation is key!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Display the live camera feed from the robot\n",
    "3. Using a gamepad controller, place a 'green dot', which corresponds to the target direction we want the robot to travel, on the image.\n",
    "4. Store the X, Y values of this green dot along with the image from the robot's camera\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the training notebook, we'll train a neural network to predict the X, Y values of our label.  In the live demo, we'll use\n",
    "the predicted X, Y values to compute an approximate steering value (it's not 'exactly' an angle, as\n",
    "that would require image calibration, but it's roughly proportional to the angle so our controller will work fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you decide exactly where to place the target for this example?  Here is a guide we think may help\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Look at the live video feed from the camera\n",
    "2.  Imagine the path that the robot should follow (try to approximate the distance it needs to avoid running off road etc.)\n",
    "3.  Place the target as far along this path as it can go so that the robot could head straight to the target without 'running off' the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, if we're on a very straight road, we could place it at the horizon.  If we're on a sharp turn, it may need to be placed closer to the robot so it doesn't run out of boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming our deep learning model works as intended, these labeling guidelines should ensure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The robot can safely travel directly towards the target (without going out of bounds etc.)\n",
    "2.  The target will continuously progress along our imagined path\n",
    "\n",
    "What we get, is a 'carrot on a stick' that moves along our desired trajectory.  Deep learning decides where to place the carrot, and JetBot just follows it :)"
