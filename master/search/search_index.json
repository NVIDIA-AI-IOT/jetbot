It is offset by 1-pin from the corner. Step 4 - Strip motor driver power cable Select the depicted micro USB from the pack Warning Pay careful attention to the image. The cables are not identical. The other micro USB cable will be used to power the Jetson Nano. Using the wrong power cable for Nano will block it's Ethernet port. Cut the depicted cable roughly ~20cm from the type-A terminal Strip the rubber coating ~3cm from the cut Remove the green / white wires and metal shielding. Strip the red and black wires about ~5mm from cut (optional) Twist the exposed strand wire and coat with solder Step 5 - Mount motor driver Route the spliced cable through chassis Secure exposed red (+) and black (-) wires to the power terminals on motor driver Warning Pay attention to the markings on the motor driver. Incorrect wiring could damage the driver.

Step 3 - Clone JetBot repo Clone the official JetBot GitHub repo . git clone http://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot.git Step 4 - Configure System First, call the scripts/configure_jetson.sh script to configure the power mode and other parameters. cd jetbot ./scripts/configure_jetson.sh Hint configure_jetson.sh also disables the GUI for the interest of saving system memory (DRAM) consumption. If you want to re-enable the GUI, you can execute the following command. sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target Optionally, you can execute this script ( ./scripts/re_enable_gui.sh ). Step 5 - Enable all containers Call the following to enable the JetBot docker containers cd docker ./enable.sh $HOME # we'll use home directory as working directory, set this as you please. Now you can go to https://<jetbot_ip>:8888 from a web browser and start programming JetBot! You can do this from any machine on your local network. The password to log in is jetbot . The enable.sh script causes the docker containers to restart at boot. This means the next time you power on your JetBot, the containers will automatically start, and you should see the IP address displayed on the PiOLED display screen. All you need to do is type this into your web browser and start programming! Tip For more information on configuring and using docker with JetBot, check out the Docker Tips page.

To go through the actual example applications on JetBot, you interact with JetBot from your (laptop) PC through Wi-Fi network. This document explains how you can initially set up the Wi-Fi connection on your Jetson. Monitor-attached Mode The easiest way to set up the Wi-Fi connection on your Jetson, is to operate on the GUI desktop. For this you need to fisrt connect the following to the Jetson on your JetBot. HDMI monitor USB keyboard USB mouse With this setup, you can use Jetson like a standard Linux computer. We call this Monitor-attached Mode . Hint If you don't have above items handy, then you can also try the headless way of configuring Wi-Fi. Head down to the next section, Headless Mode . Connect to Wi-Fi AP If a Wi-Fi adaptor (either Intel 8265 M.2 card or a USB Wi-Fi dongle) is attached, you can configure the wireless network from the desktop. Check IP address After the connection established, check the IP address. Note this IP address. Verify the IP address To test the IP address is valid and your Jetson is accesible, try connecting to the IP address from your separate (laptop) PC. SSH server is enabled by default on Jetson. Open your SSH client software (PuTTY, etc) on your PC, and try to connect the SSH server on the IP address. This is how you connect to your JetBot using SSH client software. Once you confirm you can connect to your Jetson remotely from your PC via Wi-Fi, you can now remove the HDMI monitor, keyboard and mouse from Jetson , and let your JetBot free! And at this point, you are now using Jetson effectively in the Headless Mode. Hint Alternatively, even on the GUI deskop, you can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys, and follow the command-line based setup described below for headless setup. Headless Mode When you put your Jetson in a deployed system, like a mobile robot, it is often difficult to attach an HDMI monitor. We can still control such Jetson remotely through network from a (laptop) PC, WHEN you already know the IP address . We call this operation mode Headless Mode . However you face a chiken-or-egg dillemna here, because you want to remotely login to the console to set up a Wi-Fi connection, but to do that you first need the IP address of your Jetson that you get after establishing the Wi-Fi connecton. USB Device Mode What comes handy here is USB Device Mode . You connect your (laptop) PC and Jetson using a Micro-USB cable. (Type-A end goes to your PC, Micro-B end goes to Jetson) Using this wired connection, you can access the terminal on Jetson from your (laptop) PC. With USB Device Mode, Jetson presents 3 different USB Device Class end-points to the PC that it got connected to. They function as USB mass storage device (you see L4T-README drive mounted on your PC, like a USB thumbdrive) USB serial (like the common \"FTDI\" USB to serial adapter) USB network interface card (like a virtual Ethernet adapter) With the virtual Ethernet adapter functinality, Jetson forms a virutal local Ethernet network with Jetson being 192.168.55.1 and your PC being 192.168.55.100 . So you can actually SSH login from your (laptop) PC by specifying 192.168.55.1 , if you have already set up your acount (with username and password). If you are using Jetson for the first time right after you flash your SD card, then you don't have this user account set up. In that case, you want to use the USB serial functinality, and use your serial terminal software on your PC to have accesss to the Jetson's serial terminal. So either way, with a Micro USB cable, you can have an access to Jetson's terminal. Connect Wi-Fi using nmcli command If a Wi-Fi adaptor (either Intel 8265 M.2 card or a USB Wi-Fi dongle) is attached, you can configure the wireless network using nmcli command. You can first check if you want a wireless adapter on your system.

Open your SSH client software (PuTTY, etc) on your PC, and try to connect the SSH server using the IP address you obtained on the wireless adapter. This is how you connect to your JetBot over Wi-Fi. Once you confirm you can connect to your Jetson remotely from your PC via Wi-Fi, you can now remove the Micro USB cable and let your JetBot free! Info Next, you move on to either page below.
