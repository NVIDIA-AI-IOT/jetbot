JetBot is an open-source robot based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano that is

* **Affordable** - JetBot costs less than $250 in parts, *including* Jetson Nano. There are also many [third party kits](platform/third_party) available.
* **Educational** - JetBot covers the basics like motor control, to more advanced topics like using AI for avoiding
collisions.  
* **Easy to get Started** -  Just connect your Jetson to Wifi and launch the JetBot [Docker container](docker/README.md).  This enables JetBot's web programming environment, which is available even after the JetBot reboots.  
* **Fun!** - Using JetBot's Jupyter Lab programming environment, just type your JetBot's IP address into your web browser and start programming.  Learn from the notebooks we've made, tweak them to experiment with ideas, and then create an entirely new program or project of your own!

Even if you have something other than robotics in mind, you may find the contents in JetBot helpful for learning AI and getting start with Jetson Nano.

To get started, follow the [Quick Start](platform/README.md) guide.
